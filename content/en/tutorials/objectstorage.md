## Overview

Object Storage is like Dropbox, but bigger ... it basically allows you to simply store files and they can be accessible via links on the web (or APIs) and you don't have to monitor the size of the disk (as opposed to block storage) and it comes with very nice features for mirroring your data to other regions or tiering data (making it cheaper to store if files are not accessed very often).

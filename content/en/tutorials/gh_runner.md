## Overview

This section describes how to setup a Github action runner on the cloud that you
can then use to run huge Github workflows that wouldn't run in the hosted
runners :)

## Create a new VM or HPC

See our [VM](./../vm) or [HPC](./../hpc) Tutorials.

## Configure Github

Go to the repository settings and under `Actions` you will find `Runners` where you can add a self-hosted runner:

After clicking on `New self-hosted runner` and selecting Linux you can copy and paste the first section to the VM created in Step 1:

run the commands listed on that page in your VM and accept the defaults.

To keep the session running you can use either tmux:
```
sudo install tmux
tmux new -s runner
./run.sh
CTRL-B d
```

Or as an alternative start it as a service, because this will then survive restarts of the VM:
```
sudo ./svc.sh install
sudo ./svc.sh start
```

## Use custom runner in Action
```
# Use this YAML in your workflow file for each job
runs-on: self-hosted
```

Here is an example: https://github.com/QSMxT/QSMxT/blob/master/.github/workflows/test_segmentation_pipeline.yml
